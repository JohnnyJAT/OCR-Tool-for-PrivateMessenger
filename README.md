# OPTICAL CHARACTER RECOGNITION TOOL

## Introduction
This tool is used in conversion of images of typed, handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text, whether from a scanned document, a photo of a document, a scene-photo (for example the text on signs and billboards in a landscape photo).It is widely used as a form of information entry from printed paper data records, whether passport documents, invoices, bank statements, computerised receipts, business cards, mail, printouts of static-data, or any suitable documentation. It is a common method of digitising printed texts so that they can be electronically edited, searched, stored more compactly, displayed on-line, and used in machine processes such as cognitive computing, machine translation, (extracted) text-to-speech, key data and text mining.

BUT here we are concentrating only on the scanned images or photoed images of documents or scene-photos. We'll be implementing it in our native messenger app to help connected users share text from images rather than typing, Eg: NOTE sharing for editing or for making some printed document, editable after share. 

OCR is a field of research in pattern recognition, artificial intelligence and computer vision.
